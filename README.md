# UnityThemeParkProject
"the most interesting theme park project I've seen since Nolimits 2"  This ambitious project is a unity theme park game that will be like virtual towers online, with several parks and areas to explore. This project is in the starting phases and we are still looking for members to join us on this incredible journey!  we are looking for: - People with experience in C# and unity - model makers with experience in blender - people with ideas for theme parks and areas to recreate - anyone with ideas they want to share!  We will try and keep play ability at a high with low end device optimisation and possibly a few other ports   We'll see you there! https://discord.gg/HtHqx4zFpv
